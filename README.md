## The challenge

The task I took up was to construct a Shopping Cart App equipped with the following user functionalities:

- Dynamically updating the total price and quantity as items are added or removed
- Clearing all items from the cart
- Adjusting the quantity of individual items directly from the cart
- Implementing hover and focus states to all interactive elements on the page

The app was built using React and Redux Toolkit to provide a smooth and intuitive shopping experience, enabling users to manage their virtual cart with unparalleled precision and convenience.
