## The challenge

The task I took up was to construct a Shopping Cart App equipped with the following user functionalities:

- Dynamically updating the total price and quantity as items are added or removed
- Clearing all items from the cart
- Adjusting the quantity of individual items directly from the cart
- Implementing hover and focus states to all interactive elements on the page

The app was built using React and Redux Toolkit to provide a smooth and intuitive shopping experience, enabling users to manage their virtual cart with unparalleled precision and convenience.

### My favorite code

My favorites from this challenge:

```js
   newItem: (state, action) => {
      let newItem;
      for (let i = 0; i < Items.length; i++) {
        const itemExists = state.cartItems.some(
          (item) => item.id === Items[i].id
        );
        if (!itemExists) {
          newItem = Items[i];
          break;
        }
      }
      if (!newItem) return;

      state.cartItems = [...state.cartItems, newItem];
    },


```
